and further.

* TODO When selection is active "raise" should raise it
* TODO Backspace should delete preceding sexp
* TODO Replace C-w backward-delete-word may be on the base of the paredit-backward-delete (it deletes one character at a time

* TODO May be implement moving of the left paren of the sexp
Lem's paredit does not support slurping and barfing which moves the left paren
of the sexp. But Emacs's does (if i remember correctly). Probably it should be implemented
in the Paredit first.

* BUGS

** TODO When raising not the last item, cursor remains on a wrong line
but should be on the last paren of the raised sexp.

There will be a problem if you raise a doooom:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(progn
   (make-instanse 'dooooom)
   (make-instanse 'basdsad))
#+END_SRC
